  <h2>Events</h2>
<br>
  <p>At Mind Over Matter, we are committed to supporting the mental health and well-being of our community. Unfortunately, due to the current circumstances with short staff, we do not have any future fundraising events planned at this time.
     However, we are hopeful that we will be able to return to working in the community and hosting fundraising events soon. In the meantime, we appreciate any volunteers that can help us continue our important work supporting those in need.
     Thank you for your understanding and support. Find out how you can help the cause <a href="Contact.html">here</a></p>

  <h2>Our Previous Events</h2>
<br>
  <p>At Mind Over Matte, we recently completed a fundraiser in the community and we are thrilled to report that it was a great success!
    The event, which was held at the local community center, featured a variety of activities and attractions, including a bake sale, raffle, and live music.
     We were overwhelmed by the turnout and support we received from the community, with many people coming out to show their support for our cause.
     The fundraiser was a wonderful opportunity for us to raise awareness about mental health and the importance of seeking support when needed.
     We are grateful to everyone who participated and contributed to the success of the event.
      The funds raised will be used to support our ongoing efforts to improve mental health research and well-being in the community.</p>
