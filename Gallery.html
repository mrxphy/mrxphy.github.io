  <img src="images/image-gallery1.png" alt="image 1" data-text="This image showcases the great effect that a routine has on your mental health. Having a routine can be extremely important for mental health because it helps to provide structure and stability in our daily lives.
   A routine can help to reduce stress and anxiety by giving us a clear sense of what needs to be done and when, and it can also help to improve our mood and overall well-being by providing a sense of accomplishment and purpose.
    Additionally, a routine can help us to establish healthy habits, such as regular exercise, sleep, and relaxation, which are all important for maintaining good mental health.
     By establishing and maintaining a healthy routine, we can better manage our emotions and responsibilities, leading to a greater sense of control and overall well-being.

  <img src="images/image-gallery2.jpg" alt="image 2" data-text="This image is to showcase how broad mental health is. Mental health is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of conditions and disorders that can affect a person's emotions, thoughts, and behaviors.
   Mental health issues can range from mild to severe, and they can include conditions such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, among others.
    It is important to recognize that mental health is a spectrum and that different people may experience different mental health challenges at different times in their lives.
    It is also important to understand that mental health is just as important as physical health and that it is important to prioritize and take care of both. The image you clicked on is royalty free. This text will disappear in 20 seconds!" onclick="displayDataText(this)" class="image">

  <img src="images/image-gallery3.jpg" alt="image 3" data-text="This image showcases the importance of excercise for your mental health. Exercise is important for mental health in a number of ways.
  Regular physical activity can help to reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and increase self-esteem and confidence. Exercise can also help to improve sleep, which is essential for good mental health.
  In addition, exercise has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators.
  By engaging in regular exercise, you can improve your mental health and overall well-being, leading to a happier and more fulfilling life. The image you clicked on is royalty free. This text will disappear in 20 seconds!" onclick="displayDataText(this)" class="image">

  <img src="images/image-gallery4.jpg" alt="image 4" data-text="Speaking to people about your mental health can be an important step in improving and maintaining good mental health.
   Sharing your thoughts and feelings with others can help to alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can be common among people who are struggling with mental health issues.
   Talking about your mental health with friends, family, or a mental health professional can also help you to better understand your own thoughts and feelings, and can provide you with valuable perspective and support.
   In addition, speaking openly about your mental health can help to break down stigma and create a more supportive and understanding environment for all people.
   By talking about your mental health, you can take an important step towards healing and improving your overall well-being. The image you clicked on is royalty free. This text will disappear in 20 seconds!" onclick="displayDataText(this)" class="image">
