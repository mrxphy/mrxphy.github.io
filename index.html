        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <br>
        <p>One in three adults in the USA struggle with depression. The depression rates among adults in the United States jumped from 8.5% to 32.8% in the last 3 years. These stats aren't something we can just ignore.
          A lot more people than we think suffer with depression and it is becoming a huge problem in a lot of countries, which is why we want to work together to help make the world a happier place.</p>

          <h2>Mental Health Research</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Mental health research is important because it helps us better understand mental health conditions and how to effectively treat and manage them.
            By studying the underlying causes of mental health conditions, researchers can identify potential targets for new treatments and therapies.
            This can lead to the development of more effective treatments for a wide range of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
            Mental health research can also help identify risk factors for mental health conditions and ways to prevent or reduce the impact of these conditions on individuals and communities.
            Additionally, mental health research can help to reduce the stigma associated with mental health conditions and increase awareness and understanding of these conditions among the general public.
            Overall, mental health research has the potential to significantly improve the lives of those affected by mental health conditions and the well-being of society as a whole.</p>
